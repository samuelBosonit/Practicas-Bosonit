            Angular is an open source framework developed by Google to
            facilitate the creation and programming of single page web
            applications, the SPA (Single Page Application ) websites.
          </p>

          <p>
            Angular completely separates the frontend and backend in the
            application, avoids writing repetitive code and keeps everything
            more organized thanks to its MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern,
            ensuring rapid development, while allowing modifications and
            updates.
          </p>

          <p>
            In a SPA website, although the loading speed can be a bit slow the
            first time it is opened, browsing afterwards is totally
            instantaneous, since the entire page has been loaded at once.
          </p>

          <p>
            It is only a route that has to be sent to the server, and what
            Angular does 'underneath' is to change the view when browsing so
            that it gives the appearance of a normal web, but in a more dynamic
            way.
          </p>

          <p>
            Among other advantages, this framework is modular and scalable,
            adapting to our needs and being based on the web component standard,
            and with a set of application programming interfaces (API) it allows
            us to create new custom HTML tags that can be reused.
          </p>

          <p>
            The main programming language of Angular is Typescript , and thus
            all the syntax and the way of doing things in the code is the same,
            which adds coherence and consistency to the information, allowing
            for example, the incorporation of new programmers, in if necessary,
            since they can continue their work without undue difficulty.
          </p>

          <p>
            As already indicated, Angular templates store the user interface
            code (front-end) and the business logic code (back-end) separately,
            which, among other benefits, allows better use of other previously
            existing tools.
          </p>

          <p>
            And as if that were not enough, the main editors and integrated
            development environments (IDEs) already offer extensions to be able
            to work with this framework more comfortably.
          </p>

          <p>
            Due to its reactive programming, the view is automatically updated
            after changes are made. In addition, Angular has a command line
            wizard to be able to create base projects and it also integrates
            well with testing tools and with Ionic , which facilitates the
            creation of web-responsive, that is, adapted to mobiles.
          </p>

          <p>
            This aspect is becoming more important every day both due to the
            growing use of these devices to access the internet and due to the
            penalization that Google makes of those pages that do not facilitate
            their visit on any device.

            This guide explains how to set up your environment for Angular
            development using the Angular CLI Tool . It includes information
            about prerequisites, installing the CLI, creating an initial
            workspace and startup application, and running that application
            locally to verify its configuration.

            To use the Angular framework, you must be familiar with the
            following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>javascript</li>
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Knowledge of TypeScript is helpful, but not required.</p>
          <p>
            To install Angular on your local system, you need the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Node.js
              <p>
                Angular requires a current, active LTS, or maintenance LTS
                version of Node.js.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              npm package manager
              <p>
                Angular, Angular CLI, and Angular applications depend on npm
                packages for many features and functions. To download and
                install npm packages, you need an npm package manager. This
                guide uses the npm client command line interface , which is
                installed Node.jsby default. To check that you have the npm
                client installed, run npm -vin a terminal.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Install_the_Angular_CLI">
        <header>Install the Angular CLI</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            You'll use the Angular CLI to create projects, generate application
            and library code, and perform a variety of development tasks, such
            as testing, bundling, and deployment.
          </p>

          <p>
            To install Angular CLI, open a terminal and run the following
            command:
          </p>
          <code> install -g @angular/cli</code>
        </article>

        <header>Create a workspace</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            You develop applications in the context of an Angular workspace .
          </p>

          <p>To create a new workspace and starter app:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Run the CLI command ng newand provide the name my-app, as shown
              here:
              <code>ng new my-app</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              The command ng newwill prompt you for information about the
              features to include in the initial application. Accept the default
              values by pressing the Enter or Return key.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The Angular CLI installs the necessary Angular npm packages and
            other dependencies. This may take a few minutes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The CLI creates a new workspace and a simple welcome application,
            ready to run.
          </p>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Run_the_app">
        <header>Run the app</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            Angular's CLI includes a server, so you can build and serve your
            application locally.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Navigate to the workspace folder, such as my-app.</li>
            <li>
              Run the following command:
              <code
                >cd my-app<br />
                ng serve --open</code
              >
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The command ng servestarts the server, looks at your files, and
            rebuilds the application as you make changes to those files.
          </p>
          <p>
            The option --open(or just -o) automatically opens your browser in
            http://localhost:4200/.
          </p>
          <p>
            If your installation and configuration was successful, you should
            see a page similar to the following.

            A file named angular.json at the root level of an Angular workspace
            provides workspace-wide and project-specific configuration defaults
            for build and development tools provided by the Angular CLI. Path
            values given in the configuration are relative to the root workspace
            folder.

            At the top level of angular.json, a few properties configure the
            workspace, and a projects section contains the remaining per-project
            configuration options. CLI defaults set at the workspace level can
            be overridden by defaults set at the project level, and defaults set
            at the project level can be overridden on the command line.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following properties, at the top level of the file, configure
            the workspace.

            </li>
            <li>
              defaultProject: Default project name to use in commands, where not
              provided as an argument. When you use ng new to create a new app
              in a new workspace, that app is the default project for the
              workspace until you change it here.
            </li>
            <li>
              schematics : A set of schematics that customize the ng generate
              sub-command option defaults for this workspace. See Generation
              schematics below.
            </li>
            <li>
              projects : Contains a subsection for each project (library or
              application) in the workspace, with the per-project configuration
              options.
